This section provides a qualitative treatment of the reaction of the Havven system in response to various scenarios listed below:

\todo[inline]{Scenario analysis.}

\subsection{Scenarios}

\paragraph{Curits appreciate against nomins.}
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Curit-holders can issue more nomins.}

	This might be scary because we either want the nomin supply to fall, or nomin demand to increase.
	This is fine if the nomin price fell, because then nomin demand should increase.
	However, if it was simply that the curit price increased, then this might encourage
	oversupply of nomins as issuers compete for shares of the fee pool.

	\item{Cheaper exit}

	Anyone who has previously issued curits but who wants to exit can buy nomins for
	cheaper than they issued them at, so egress with a profit.
	Alternatively, if the curit price doubles, then only half of their stake is required
	to back the nomins they have issued. They can use these proceeds to completely liquidate
	their position.

	\item{Each nomin locks fewer curits.}
	
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Curits depreciate against nomins.}
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Curit-holders can issue fewer nomins.}
	
	Perhaps they may even be under-staked.

	\item{Each nomin locks more curits.}
	\item{A player can issue a quantity of nomins and sell them for curits.}
		  
	They would do this on the assumption that, once the nomin price decreases as a result of the increased
	supply, they will be able to buy back the same quantity of nomins to free up their
	curits more cheaply.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Why would anyone issue nomins?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Fees
	\item Because they thought the peg would break in the positive direction.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Ratio moves favourably
	\item Ratio moves unfavourably
		\subitem Accumulate Curits
			\subsubitem Few Curits available.
			\subsubitem No Curits available.
		\subitem Accumulate Nomis
			\subsubitem Few Nomins available.
			\subsubitem No Nomins available.
	\item Creation of new Curits with new funds (not currently explored).
\end{enumerate}
