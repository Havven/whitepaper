\section{System Description} Havven is a dual-token system that, combined
with a set of novel incentive mechanisms, stabilises the price of the nomin
with respect to an external asset. Users of the nomin token pay the owners of
the havven token for collateralising and stabilising the system. \\

\noindent The havven token incentivises those who hold it to fulfil two functions:

\begin{itemize}
\item{To provide the system with collateral.}
\item{To participate in the stabilisation of the nomin price.} \\
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Collateralisation} \\

\noindent Confidence in the stability of the nomin begins with
overcollateralisation, so that the value of escrowed havvens is greater than
the value of nomins in circulation. As long as the ratio of total nomin value
to total havven value remains favourable, there is sufficient backing in the
underlying collateral pool to ensure that nomins can be redeemed for their
face value. The redeemability of a nomin for the havvens against which it was
issued strongly supports a stable price. \\

\noindent \textbf{Stabilisation Incentives} \\

\noindent Havven rewards those that have issued nomins. These rewards are
derived from transaction fees and are distributed in proportion with how
effectively each issuer acts to maintain the correct nomin supply.
The system monitors the nomin price, and responds by adjusting its targeted
global supply, which individual issuers are incentivised to move towards. \\

\noindent Where volatility persists, stronger stabilisation mechanisms may be
applied, for example automated collateral recovery. Where a significant
portion of nomins are being used for hedging, (and hence not generating
transaction fees) a charge can be applied to ensure that the cost of utility
for hedging is not being solely borne by transactions.
