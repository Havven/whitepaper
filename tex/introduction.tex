\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Money and Cryptocurrencies}

\noindent The technology of money has three key functions: to act as a unit of account, a medium of
exchange and a store of value. In addition, money should ideally exhibit durability,
portability, divisibility, uniformity, limited supply, and acceptability.
As payment technology has advanced in recent years, it has become increasingly invisible
and it is often lost upon users of money that, like any technology, it can be improved.
Specifically, this means improving the performance of those desirable properties. \\

\noindent Bitcoin is an impressive technological advancement on existing forms of money because it simultaneously improves durability, portability, and divisibility. Further, it does so without requiring centralised control or the enforcement of a nation state from which to derive its value. This fixed monetary policy has protected Bitcoin from debasement and devaluation, allowing it to outperform other forms of money as a store of value. But this has created the potential for short-run volatility as Bitcoin lacks a mechanism to dynamically adjust to changing demand. \\

\noindent Bitcoin has thus tended to be a poor medium of exchange and an even worse unit of account.
In order for something to perform these functions it must remain
relatively stable against the price of goods and services over the short to medium term.

\subsection{Stablecoins}

\noindent A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency designed for price stability, such that it can function both as a medium of exchange and unit of account. It should ideally be as effective for making payments
as fiat currencies like the US Dollar, but still retain the desirable characteristics of Bitcoin, namely
transaction immutability, censorship resistance and decentralisation. \\

\noindent Cryptocurrencies that exhibit these characteristics are clearly a far better form of money; but adoption has been hindered by the volatility inherent in the inflexible monetary policies employed by decentralised systems. Thus stability continues to be one of the most valuable yet elusive characteristics for the technology. Clearly, efforts to create dynamic monetary policies within cryptoeconomic systems is still nascent, and significant research into stable monetary frameworks for cryptocurrencies is required. \\

\noindent The interested reader can also find additional discussion of stablecoins,
cryptoeconomics, competitors, and other related topics on our blog at \href{http://blog.havven.io}{\texttt{http://blog.havven.io}}.

\subsection{Havven}

\noindent Havven is a decentralised stability marketplace, where users requiring stability transact directly with those who provide the collateral to create it. This enables a novel form of representative money in which there is no requirement for a physical asset, thus removing problems of trust and custodianship. The asset used to back the stablecoin is a pool of reserve tokens that collectively represent the system itself; controlling these reserve tokens reflects participation in the Havven system, and they are a proxy for its value. Havven generates fees from users who transact in the stablecoin and distributes them among the holders of the reserve token, compensating them for underpinning the system. Havven therefore rewards those who actively participate in maintaining the stability of the system and charges those who benefit from its utility. These rewards are proportionally applied in response to the active management of the supply of the exchange token such that its price mirrors that of the asset it tracks. \\

\noindent Because we have created a system that generates cash flow for participants, we now have an asset which can be used as the collateral to support the stablecoin with a well-defined market value. The key to this is that the value of the system is measured in USD. This allows the system to issue a stablecoin which can be presented and redeemed for a percentage of the collateral tokens valued at 1 USD. Backing a stablecoin in this way is beneficial because such a cryptoeconomic system does not require trust in a centralised party; each participant has full transparency over how many tokens have been issued against the available collateral at all times. \\

\noindent The two linked tokens and the complex of incentives are described below: \\

\noindent The collateral token, whose supply is static.
The capitalisation of the havvens in the market reflects both the system's aggregate value and the reserve
which backs the stablecoin. Thus, users who hold havvens take on the role of maintaining stability.
Following Bitcoin, the Havven system will appear in upper case and singular; while the havven
token will be lower case and may be plural.

\noindent \textbf{Nomin}

\vspace{1mm}

\noindent The exchange token - the stablecoin - whose supply floats.
Its price as measured in fiat currency should be relatively stable.
Other than price stability, the system should also encourage some adequate level
of liquidity for nomins to act as a useful medium of exchange. \\

\noindent Each holder of havvens is able to issue a value of nomins in proportion to the USD value
of the havvens they hold and are willing to place into escrow. If the user wishes to release their escrowed havvens, they must
present the system with nomins in order to free their havvens and trade them again.
The holders of this token provide both collateral and liquidity, and in so doing assume some
level of risk. To compensate this risk, such nomin-issuers will be rewarded with fees the system levies
automatically as part of its normal operation. \\

\subsection{Design Rationale}

\noindent This issuance mechanism allows nomins to act as a form of representative money, where each nomin represents a share in the havven value held in reserve. Nomins derive value insofar as they provide a superior medium of exchange, and are effectively redeemable for a constant value of the denominating asset. In this paper, we use USD as this asset, but this could be any external and appropriately fungible asset, such as a commodity or a fiat currency. \\

\noindent In this manner, the system incentivises the issuance and destruction of nomins so that the value of the nomin pool expands and contracts in proportion with the total value of havvens backing them. If price changes exogenously, then the system is designed to provide incentives for actors to recalibrate to the new price. The mechanism design of the system and these incentives is described in detail in section 2. \\

\noindent Due to denominating the value of the stablecoin in an external fiat currency stability is relative only to that currency. In the future the system may support additional 'flavors' of stablecoin that are denominated in other currencies such as the Euro. Denominating the stablecoin in a fiat currency removes the need to respond to macroeconomic conditions, as it benefits from the stabilisation efforts of large institutions acting in fiat markets. \\
%\noindent The design choice to back the system with a self-referential token was obvious;
%an asset-backed stablecoin with a cryptocurrency basket as reserve will always be inherently
%volatile, despite diversification, and will never be able to achieve the bespoke functionality
%of an asset which derives its value from stability. \\

\noindent Havven overcollateralises the pool of circulating currency, thus insulating itself against dramatic corrections in the havven market. This raises the cost of stabilising the currency which is why the market mechanism inherent in the system is critical for finding an equilibrium between demand for a stable cryptocurrency and the supply of collateral to back it at a certain price. There is a trade-off between the cost inherent in the collateralisation ratio and the circulating supply. To illustrate: if the ratio is set to 100:1 then the price of Havvens would need to fall 99\% for the stablecoin to no longer be fully collateralised. Similarly the ratio could be set to 1:1 initially, but any decrease in price would mean the currency was no longer overcollaterised. The trade-off between these two levels is determined by the cost of capital and the fee yield. The lower the collateralisation ratio the higher the fee yield for any given demand in currency. Thus the system needs to be adjusted to a level where protection from price shocks is balanced against the fee yield. \\
