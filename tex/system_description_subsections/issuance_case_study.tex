\subsection{Issuance Case Study} In this section we illustrate how Havven's inecentives encourage havven holders to maintain stability. We denote the fraction of e-commerce transactions using nomins with $\varepsilon GDP$ and assume the following inverse demand function for the nomin price:
\begin{equation*} \label{eq:nominprice}
P_{n,t} = \frac{\varepsilon GDP_t}{v_tN_t} 
\end{equation*}

\noindent The expected profit of a havven holder $i$ in period $t$, with respect to fees and their issuance actions can be expressed as follows: 
\begin{equation*} \label{eq:profit}
\pi_{i,t} = \phi_{r,i,t} \frac{H_{i,t}}{r} + (N_{i,t} - N_{i,t-1}) P_{n,t}
\end{equation*}

\subsubsection{Initial Conditions} For simplicity, we consider a system which has only two havven holders. The first havven holder owns 100 havvens and has issued 50 nomins. The second owns 200 havvens and has issued 100 nomins. Neither havven holder buys or sells havvens:
\begin{align*}
H &= 300 & H_1 &= 100 & H_2 &= 200 \\
N_{-1} &= 150 & N_{1,-1} &= 50 & N_{2,-1} &= 100
\end{align*}

\noindent The transaction fee rate ($\phi_\epsilon$), interest rate (r) and velocity (v) are fixed throughout:
\begin{align*}
\phi_\epsilon &= 0.2\% & r &= 0.6\%  & v &= 6
\end{align*}

\noindent The values of the price sensitivivty parameter ($\sigma$), the flattening parameter ($\psi$) and the $C_{max}$ multiplier ($a$) are: 
\begin{align*}
\sigma &= 50 & \psi &= 3 & a&= 1.25
\end{align*}

\noindent To evaluate $P_{n,-1}$ we assume that $\varepsilon GDP_{-1} = 900$. We can now also evaluate $P_{h,-1}$ and the initial collateralisation ratios:
\begin{table}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|m{1cm}|m{1cm}|m{1cm}|m{1cm}|m{1cm}|m{1cm}|m{1cm}|m{1cm}|}
		\hline
		\text{$P_{n,-1}$}&\text{$P_{h,-1}$}&\text{$C_{-1}$}&\text{$C_{1,-1}$}&\text{$C_{2,-1}$}&\text{$f(P_{n,-1})$}&\text{$C_{opt,-1}$}&\text{$C_{max,-1}$}\\
		\hline
		1 & 1 & 0.5 & 0.5 & 0.5 & 1 & 0.5 & 0.625 \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Prices and collateralisation; t = -1}
	\label{table:initial conditions}
\end{table}

\noindent The number of escrowed havvens for each havven holder is given by equation \eqref{eq:escrowed}. We can also evaluate their expected profits:
\begin{align*}
\check{H}_{1,-1} &= 80 & \pi_{1,-1} &= 100 \\
\check{H}_{2,-1} &= 160 & \pi_{2,-1} &= 200 
\end{align*}

\newpage

\noindent At the beginning of period $t=0$, there is a 10\% decrease in $\varepsilon GDP$ causing the nomin price $P_n$ to decrease from \$1 to \$0.90:

\begin{table}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|m{1cm}|m{1cm}|m{1cm}|m{1cm}|m{1cm}|m{1cm}|m{1cm}|m{1cm}|}
		\hline
		\text{$P_{n,0}$}&\text{$P_{h,0}$}&\text{$C_0$}&\text{$C_{1,0}$}&\text{$C_{2,0}$}&\text{$f(P_{n,0})$}&\text{$C_{opt,0}$}&\text{$C_{max,0}$}\\
		\hline
		0.9 & 0.9 & 0.5 & 0.5 & 0.5 & 0.905 &  0.4525 & 0.5656 \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Negative shock; no change; t = 0}
	\label{table:Prices and collateralisation; t=0}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Neither havven holder changes} If neither havven holder changes $N_i$ then $P_n$ will remain at \$0.90. Altough for both havven holders $\phi_{r,i,1} < \phi_{base,1}$, their expected profits remain the same. This is because they have the same fee rate, all fees must be distributed and collectively they own all havvens. However, their number of locked havvens has increased:
\begin{align*}
N_{1,1} &= 50 & \check{H}_{1,1} &= 88.4 & \pi_{1,1} &= 100 \\
N_{2,1} &= 100 & \check{H}_{2,1} &= 176.8 & \pi_{2,1} &= 200 
\end{align*}

\subsubsection{Both havven holders change} Instead of remaining idle, each havven holder has an opportunity to increase $\phi_{r,i,1}$ by changing $N_{i,1}$ to align with $C_{opt,0}$:
\begin{equation*}
N_{i,1} = C_{opt,0}P_{h,0}H_i/P_{n,0}
\end{equation*}

\noindent If both havven holders target $C_{opt}$, their new nomin balances, locked havvens and expected profits are: 
\begin{align*}
N_{1,1} &= 45.25 & \check{H}_{1,1} &= 80 & \pi_{1,1} &= 86.22 \\
N_{2,1} &= 90.5 & \check{H}_{2,1} &= 160 & \pi_{2,1} &= 172.45 
\end{align*}

\noindent Due to their actions, the nomin price, $P_{n,1} \approx 1$, $f(P_{n,1})\approx 1$ and $C_{opt,1}\approx C_1$. There is no further incentive for either havven holder to change $N_i$. They also have reduced $\check{H}_i$ to the level it was originally:
\begin{table}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|m{1cm}|m{1cm}|m{1cm}|m{1cm}|m{1cm}|m{1.5cm}|m{1cm}|m{1cm}|}
		\hline
		\text{$P_{n,1}$}&\text{$P_{h,1}$}&\text{$C_1$}&\text{$C_{1,1}$}&\text{$C_{2,1}$}&\text{$f(P_{n,1})$}&\text{$C_{opt,1}$}&\text{$C_{max,1}$}\\
		\hline
		0.9945 & 0.9 & 0.500 & 0.500 & 0.500 & 0.999 & 0.499  & 0.625 \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Negative shock; both change; t = 1}
	\label{table:negative shock both follow mechanism}
\end{table}

\newpage

\subsubsection{Havven holder 1 changes} We now consider the scenario in which only the first havven holder changes $N_1$. We show the payoffs for each havven holder after 6 iterations. Havven holder $1$ improves his profit at the expense of havven holder $2$:

\begin{align*}\label{pi_neg_shock_only N1_ t=6}
N_{1,6} &= 46.57 & \check{H}_{1,6} &= 80 & \pi_{1,6} &= 118.53 \\
N_{2,6} &= 100 & \check{H}_{2,6} &= 171.77 & \pi_{2,6} &= 171.58
\end{align*}
\noindent $P_{n}$ stabilises around $\$0.921$ instead of $\$1$. The reason being that, although $P_n\neq 1$, $C_{1,6} = C_{opt,6}$. This means that havven holder $1$ has no further incentive to change $N_1$:

\begin{table}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|m{1cm}|m{1cm}|m{1cm}|m{1cm}|m{1cm}|m{1.5cm}|m{1cm}|m{1cm}|}
		\hline
		\text{$P_{n,6}$}&\text{$P_{h,6}$}&\text{$C_6$}&\text{$C_{1,6}$}&\text{$C_{2,6}$}&\text{$f(P_{n,6})$}&\text{$C_{opt,6}$}&\text{$C_{max,6}$}\\
		\hline
		0.921 & 0.9 & 0.500 & 0.477 & 0.512 & 0.953 & 0.477  & 0.596 \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Negative shock; havven holder 1 changes; t = 6}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Havven holder 2 changes} Finally, we consider the case in which only havven holder $2$ changes $N_2$:
\begin{align*}
N_{1,6} &= 50 & \check{H}_{1,6} &= 85.31 & \pi_{1,6} &= 77.25 \\
N_{2,6} &= 93.78 & \check{H}_{2,6} &= 160 & \pi_{2,6} &= 204.90
\end{align*}

\noindent In this case, havven holder $2$ improves his profit at expense of havven holder $1$. Again, $P_n$ does not stabilise at $\$1$ but does stabilise closer to $\$1$ than in the previous scenario, since havven holder $2$ has a larger fraction of $N$:
\begin{table}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|m{1cm}|m{1cm}|m{1cm}|m{1cm}|m{1cm}|m{1cm}|m{1cm}|m{1cm}|m{1.5cm}|m{1cm}|m{1cm}|}
		\hline
		\text{$P_{n,6}$}&\text{$P_{h,6}$}&\text{$C_6$}&\text{$C_{1,6}$}&\text{$C_{2,6}$}&\text{$f(P_{n,6})$}&\text{$C_{opt,6}$}&\text{$C_{max,6}$}\\
		\hline
		0.939 & 0.9 & 0.500 & 0.522 & 0.489 & 0.978 & 0.489  & 0.612 \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Negative shock; havven holder 2 changes; t = 6}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Nash Equilbrium} Both havven holders are best off by changing $N_i$ to align with $C_{opt}$. Although for each of them the best scenario would be if the other does not do anything, this scenario cannot be an equilibrium. This can be seen from the following strategic game representation of the previous analysis (for this representation, we assume that all iterations are made instantaneously and simultaneously by both havven holders).

\newpage

\begin{table}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
		\hline
		\text{}&\text{$N_{2,0}$}&\text{$N_{2}^*$}\\
		\hline
		\text{$N_{1,0}$} & 100 , 200 & 77.25 , 204.9 \\
		\hline
		\text{$N_{1}^*$} & 118.53 , 171.58 & 86.21 , 172.43 \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Negative shock; strategic game representation}
	\label{table:negative shock_strateg game represent}
\end{table}

\noindent $N_{i,0}$ is the action of maintaining the same number of nomins taken by holder $i$, whereas $N_i^*$ is the action of changing their nomin issuance. Each box has the payoff that both holders get by choosing some particular action. For example, if havven holder $1$ chooses $N_{1,0}$ and holder $2$ chooses $N_{2,0}$, the former gets a payoff of $100$ and the latter $200$. It can be seen that havven holder $1$ will choose $N_{1}^*$ no matter what action is chosen by havven holder $2$ ($1$ gets larger payoffs following $N_{1}^*$ for any action that $2$ can take). Similarly, $2$ will choose $N_{2}^*$ no matter what the action of havven holder $1$ is. In other words, action $N_i^*$ strictly dominates remaining idle with $N_{i,0}$. Therefore, $\{N_1^*,N_2^*\}$ is the unique Nash equilibrium. \\
