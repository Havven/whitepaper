\section{Quantitative System Analysis}

We take the view that falsification is an important aspect of validating
the Havven system. In our quantitative analysis we seek to identify failure modes
of the system, and also to characterise not just \textit{whether} Havven stabilises
nomin prices, but \textit{how much} it does.

\subsection{Game-theoretic modelling}
Discuss the structure of the game Havven represents, incorporating information the economists produce.
\todo[inline]{Discuss game theoretic modelling.}

\subsubsection{Actor Definitions}
\paragraph{Havven Holder}
\emph{An investor who owns \HAV{} tokens.} \\

\noindent In order to purchase \HAV{} the expected return has to be greater than that of alternative investments (opportunity cost). The expected return of \HAV{} comes from:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{The fees received on escrowed \HAV{}.}
\item{An increase in $P_h$.}
\item{Seigniorage (i.e., an increment in $P_h$ implies that the investor can issue more \NOM{}, which may eventually have a larger value than his original investment.}
\end{enumerate}

\noindent At any moment in time, the investor must decide:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Whether or not to issue new \NOM{} (assuming $U_i < U_{max}$), or to burn some of them. All \NOM{} are issued/burnt at the prevailing market exchange rate, denominated in ETH.}
\item{Whether to sell some quantity of \HAV{} in the market at price $P^M_{h,t}$. Only \HAV{} which haven't been escrowed can be sold. Otherwise they must burn \NOM{} to release them. }
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Nomin User}
\emph{A person who uses the \NOM{} token.} \\
 
\noindent In order to purchase \NOM{}, it must provide the user more utility than USD, since both have the same consumption value in the market. This utility may come from the properties of crypto. \\

\noindent At any time, they must decide: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Whether to buy or to sell \NOM{} at $P_n$.}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Agent-based modelling} It has been observed that analytic methods are often difficult to
apply in the complex and dynamic setting of a market.
One suggested solution to this problem is \textit{agent-based modelling}.
Under this paradigm, we proceed by first defining rational agent behaviour
and then simulating the interplay of those strategies over time.
We seek to develop a more effective
method of characterising market behaviour and equilibrium prices than pure analytic reasoning.~\cite{poggio2001agent}\\

\noindent Such simulations also provide an immediate means of measuring
quantities of interest. Simply by observing
the model, we can discover how varying input parameters
affect system outputs in an experimental fashion.
One important corollary is that this is a way of extracting reasonable
settings for system parameters (such as fee levels) that might be difficult
to reason about \textit{a priori}. These systems, reactive as they are,
also provide a method for testing proposed remedies for any identified failure
modes.

\todo[inline]{Discuss that the game theory conclusions can be simulated}

\noindent In sum, then, the modelling seeks to answer the following, among other questions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Does the system stabilise its nomin price?
    \item Under what conditions can stability fail?
    \item What are reasonable initial settings for fees and other parameters?
    \item What effect does the utilisation ratio have on havven/nomin price ratio?
    \item What is an effective utilisation ratio?
    \item What is the effect of a direct redemption regime?
    \item What are the expected returns for havven-holders?
\end{itemize}
