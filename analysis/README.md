# Analysis and White Paper

This is where analytical discussion of the system lives.
In order to build the document, you will need a distribution of TeX installed, and then run:

```pdflatex whitepaper.tex```

## TODO

* Formalise questions that have yet to be addressed in the discussion section
* Formalise recommendations for Havven's design in the discussion section
* Indicate assumptions that the system relies upon in the discussion section (e.g. Scalability)
* Outline a roadmap for actually building Havven in the discussion section (e.g. PreICO contract -> Solidity Smart Contract -> Own Blockchain)
* Differentiate Havven from both MakerDAO and Hayek Money, or explain why they are unviable.
