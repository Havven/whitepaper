# Havven white paper

`havven_white_paper.pdf` will be maintained as an up-to-date render of the latest under-construction Havven white paper.

The `havven_white_paper.pdf` file in the `master` branch is the latest public-consumption snapshot of the paper.

In order to build the document, you will need a distribution of TeX installed, and then run:

```pdflatex havven_white_paper.tex```

On first run this will generate a `.toc` file, and you'll notice the table of contents is blank. Run the same command a second time and it should correctly generate the whitepaper.
